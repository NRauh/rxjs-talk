# Meeting RxJS

```notes
- This is going to be a short talk to try and get you familiar with or aware of RxJS
- It's going to be pretty beginner focused
- RxJS and reactive programming are huge complex things that I don't think I'd be able to teach in one 30 minute talk
```

# Reactive Programming

```notes
- First I want to talk about reactive programming as a concept
- I'm really going to gloss over it, because I wouldn't say I'm a huge source of truth on the subject
- But I want to make you aware of it
```

---

# A Definition

* A programming paradigm
* Opposite of imperative programming
* Observing and setting data from a distance
* Usually more functional and declarative

```notes
- A rough definition of reactive programming could be that it's
- a paradigm of programming
- generally thought of as the opposite of imperative programming
- based around viewing and setting data from a far
- and not always, but it usually means you're writing more functional code
```

# Spreadsheet Cliche

```csv
10,20,=SUM(A1,B1)
```

```notes
- A really common analogy is spreadsheets
- Lets say you have two cells, and you want a third to show the sum of them
- In a spreadsheet, you'll write your fomula
- then regardless of how or when the value of either number updates, you'll have a fresh output
```

    {},
    { lines: [1] },
    { lines: [2, 3] },
    { lines: [4] },
    { lines: [6] },
    { lines: [8] },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
- Here's an example of us failing to do the same in javascript
- First we'll get an output
- Next set the numbers
- Compute the sum 
- And show an output
- But as you can imagine, when we set the number downhere, out output is still going to show the previous sum
- I'll show an example with RxJS later on
```

# Reasons to Care

* Code can be more self contained
* Manage async code
  - Network request
  - Anything the user does
* You want to write functional code

```notes
- There's a few reasons why you'd want to write reactive code
- The first reason might not be very obvious, but it's possible to write more self contained code
  - Say you have a cart
  - Rather than updating the price of a product, then explicitly telling the cart to update the total
  - The cart can essentially listen for changes to the products inside it
  - Then if the price of one changes, regardless of how, it will know to compute an updated total
- Secondly, it also really helps with managing async code
- In this context async code can mean something like
  - user input
  - a network request
  - even the user's state or flow over a process
- Race conditions are a pretty cool example
- Lastly, if you're interested in functional programming, you'll probably get more of that
```

# You're Probably Not New To This

* React is an obvious example
  - (and Redux or Mobx)
* Vue also makes it really easy
* Angular heavily uses RxJS

```notes
- You might not be too familiar with RxJS
- But most popular frameworks help you write reactive code
- React is a clear example
  - Especially with Redux or Mobx
- It's also really natural and easy to create reactive code with Vue
- And Angular and has really good support for RxJS
  - And leverages it a lot internally
```

---

# RxJS

* A library to help write reactive code
* Not a framework
* Part of ReactiveX
  - Conceptually similar libraries exist for Swift, Java, .Net, and more

```notes
- So lets talk about RxJS
- RxJS is a library that helps you write reactive code that follows the observer pattern
- It's part of reactive extensions, so similar libraries exist in many languages
  - Such as Swift, C#, and Java
  - Though I should say some versions such as the Ruby version, are completely dead and were never really used
- An important distinction to make is RxJS isn't a framework
- You are going to have a dissapointing time if you try to build a large app with just this
- That said, if you wanted you could use it to help build a framework
```

  code={require('!raw-loader!./code_samples/02_rxjs_trivial.js').default}
  lang='javascript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [1, 3] },
    { tokens: { 3: [2] } },
    { range: [5, 6], tokens: { 7: [1] } },
    { range: [5, 9] },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
- Here's a really basic example of using RxJS
- First I'm going to make on observable of `37`, `42`, `1`, and `102`
- The dollar sign at the end of our variable is just convention for saying it's an observable
- Next I'm going to pipe each value into a map function, which will multiply it by two
- Finally I'm going to subscribe to my source, which will run the callback for each value after being piped 
```

---

# Trivial Example output

```js
// The value: 74
// The value: 84
// The value: 2
// The value: 204
```

```notes
- If we were to run that code, this would be our output
- You can see it's not really much of a useful example
- But I'll build up to one that is
```

# Observable Sources

* Where your observable sequence comes from
* Examples:
  - `of`: `of(1, 2, 3)`
  - `from`: `from([1, 2, 3])`
  - `interval`: `interval(1000)`
  - `fromEvent`: `fromEvent(nukeAlertButton, 'click')`
  - `ajax`: `ajax(url)`
  - `webSocket`: `webSocket(url)`

```notes
- Observables are a sequences of data over time
- They can come from a number of sources, here are some examples
- of and from are almost the same
  - They take a set of values (they don't have to be numbers) and iterate over them
  - of uses indefinite parameters, from uses an array
- interval will emit an incremented number after a given time
- fromEvent is basically an event listener on a DOM element
- ajax sends an HTTP request, and the result comes in an observable
- webSocket is a websocket connection where each response is a sequence in an observable
```

# Operators

* Let you pipe a value down and do an action against it

```notes
- One of the really powerful things about RxJS are it's operators
- They let you manipulate or do something against the value of your observable
- And they let you do this in a pretty functional and declarative way
```

<CodeSurfer
  title='Operators'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code_samples/03_operators.js').default}
  lang='javascript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [3, 4] },
    { lines: [6] },
    { lines: [7, 11] },
    { lines: [7, 8, 11] },
    { lines: [7, 8, 9, 11] },
    { range: [7, 11] },
    { range: [13, 15] },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
- I already showed off `map` earlier
- But let's go through another simple example
- First I'm going to grab a couple elements
- Then I'm going to make an observable from click events
- Next I'm going to make another observable that's going to be a manipulated version of the click event
- Inside of my pipe, I'm going to first debounce clicks
  - This will make it so events that happen inside 200ms are ignore
- Next I'm going to use tap, which will just do something after debouncing
  - In this case write to the console
- Finally, for some reason I'm going to wait half a second before running our subscription
- My subscription will essentially say it was clicked
- We're doing some really complex things in just a few lines of code
- Thanks to the operators
```

<CodeSurfer
  title='Subjects'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code_samples/04_subject_example.js').default}
  lang='javascript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [1, 3] },
    { lines: [4] },
    { range: [6, 7] },
    {}
  ]}
/>

```notes
- RxJS also has a thing called a subject
- You can think of them a bit like reactive variables
- Here's an example of using one
- First I'm going to make a new subject
- Next I'm going to make a subscription to it
- Lastly I'm going to give it a couple values
- So if we were to run this, you'd see the subscription ran for each value
```

---

# Subjects Sources

* `Subject`
* `BehaviorSubject`
* `ReplaySubject`
* `AsyncSubject`

```notes
- Here are some different subjects you can create
- There mostly the same, but when their subscriptions run, will be a bit different
- With `Subject` new subscriptions will only run with values given after the subscription was created
- `BehaviorSubject` new subscriptions will automatically run with the current or last value
- `ReplaySubject` will run new subscriptions with every previous value
- `AsyncSubject` will wait until it's told it's complete then run the subscriptions with each value
```
