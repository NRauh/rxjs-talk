# Meeting RxJS

```notes
- This is going to be a short talk to try and get you familiar with or aware of RxJS
- It's going to be pretty beginner focused
- RxJS and reactive programming are huge complex things that I don't think I'd be able to teach in one 30 minute talk
```

# Reactive Programming

```notes
- First I want to talk about reactive programming as a concept
- I'm really going to gloss over it, because I wouldn't say I'm a huge source of truth on the subject
- But I want to make you aware of it
```

---

# A Definition

* A programming paradigm
* Opposite of imperative programming
* Observing and setting data from a distance
* Usually more functional and declarative

```notes
- A rough definition of reactive programming could be that it's
- a paradigm of programming
- generally thought of as the opposite of imperative programming
- based around viewing and setting data from a far
- and not always, but it usually means you're writing more functional code

# Spreadsheet Cliche

```csv
10,20,=SUM(A1,B1)
```

```notes
- A really common analogy is spreadsheets
- Lets say you have two cells, and you want a third to show the sum of them
- In a spreadsheet, you'll write your fomula
- then regardless of how or when the value of either number updates, you'll have a fresh output
```

<CodeSurfer
  title='Imperative Sum'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./code_samples/01_sad_sum.js').default}
  lang='javascript'
  steps={[
    {},
    { lines: [1] },
    { lines: [2, 3] },
    { lines: [4] },
    { lines: [6] },
    { lines: [8] },
    {},
  ]}
/>

```notes
- Here's an example of us failing to do the same in javascript
- First we'll get an output
- Next set the numbers
- Compute the sum 
- And show an output
- But as you can imagine, when we set the number downhere, out output is still going to show the previous sum
- I'll show an example with RxJS later on
```

# Reasons to Care

* Code can be more self contained
* Manage async code
  - Network request
  - Anything the user does
* You want to write functional code

```notes
- There's a few reasons why you'd want to write reactive code
- The first reason might not be very obvious, but it's possible to write more self contained code
  - Say you have a cart
  - Rather than updating the price of a product, then explicitly telling the cart to update the total
  - The cart can essentially listen for changes to the products inside it
  - Then if the price of one changes, regardless of how, it will know to compute an updated total
- Secondly, it also really helps with managing async code
- In this context async code can mean something like
  - user input
  - a network request
  - even the user's state or flow over a process
- Lastly, if you're interested in functional programming, you'll probably get more of that
```

# You're Probably Not New To This

* React is an obvious example
  - (and Redux or Mobx)
* Vue also makes it really easy
* Angular heavily uses RxJS

```notes
- You might not be too familiar with RxJS
- But most popular frameworks help you write reactive code
- React is a clear example
  - Especially with Redux or Mobx
- It's also really natural and easy to create reactive code with Vue
- And Angular and has really good support for RxJS
  - And leverages it a lot internally
```
